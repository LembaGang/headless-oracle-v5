# Active Priorities — Headless Oracle V5
<!-- Claude: update this file after significant work to preserve state across sessions -->

## Current Status
**Phase**: Production-ready. All engineering complete. Pre-launch marketing phase.
**Test suite**: 66/66 tests passing
**Last significant work**: Feb 20 2026 — operator runbook written, file organisation done, full
handover package prepared, all repos committed and pushed, all internal links fixed to extensionless paths.
**Next session trigger**: User completes human tasks → HN launch March 10.

## Immediate Next Engineering Tasks (when user returns)
1. **Add rate limiting in Cloudflare Dashboard** — must be done before HN launch (March 10)
   - Dashboard: Workers & Pages → headless-oracle-v5 → Settings → Rate Limiting
   - Rules to add:
     - `/v5/demo*`     → 100 req/min per IP → Block (429)
     - `/v5/schedule*` → 60 req/min per IP  → Block (429)
     - `/v5/exchanges` → 60 req/min per IP  → Block (429)
     - `/v5/keys`      → 60 req/min per IP  → Block (429)
   - `/v5/status` is already protected by API key auth — no rate limit rule needed
   - **This is a human task** — must be done in the Cloudflare Dashboard

2. **Beta API key provisioning** — when first prospect wants to test /v5/status
   - Add their key to `BETA_API_KEYS` secret via:
     `wrangler secret put BETA_API_KEYS` (enter comma-separated list including new key)
   - Format: `existing_key,new_key_for_ondo`
   - Then redeploy: `wrangler deploy`

3. **Monitoring / alerting** — optional but recommended before scale
   - Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers & Pages → headless-oracle-v5 → Metrics
   - Set up email alerts for Worker errors (4xx/5xx spikes)

## Sprint Goals (Pre-March 8)
- [x] 7 exchanges live and tested
- [x] /v5/schedule and /v5/exchanges endpoints live
- [x] KV circuit breaker override system live
- [x] status.html live dashboard
- [x] 66-test suite passing
- [x] CLAUDE.md files updated in both repos
- [x] Risk committee status update written
- [x] Financial model written
- [x] DST exploit demo repo published on GitHub (github.com/LembaGang/dst-exploit-demo)
- [x] All internal frontend links fixed (extensionless paths)
- [x] Operator runbook written (headless-oracle-v5/OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md)
- [x] Business handover document written (C:/Users/User/Headless Oracle/Business/HANDOVER.md)
- [ ] Phantom Hour article published (human task — Gemini draft ready)
- [ ] Twitter/X thread posted (human task)
- [ ] 15 targeted DMs sent (human task — begins Feb 28)
- [ ] Rate limiting configured in Cloudflare Dashboard (human task — before March 10)

## Codebase Health
- **Worker**: headless-oracle-v5 | main branch | deployed to Cloudflare Workers
- **Frontend**: headless-oracle-web | main branch | deployed to Cloudflare Pages via `npm run deploy`
- **DST Demo**: dst-exploit-demo | master branch | published on GitHub
- **Tests**: 66/66 passing. `.dev.vars` populated with test-only keypair.
- **Public key**: `03dc27993a2c90856cdeb45e228ac065f18f69f0933c917b2336c1e75712f178` (production)
- **All live pages**: headlessoracle.com, /docs, /status, /verify, /terms, /privacy, /llms.txt

## Known Issues / Blockers
- **No rate limiting on public routes yet**: Acceptable at zero-traffic stage. Must add before HN launch.
  See: OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md → Section 5. Dashboard instructions are ready.

## DST Calendar — Critical Dates
- **March 8, 2026**: US clocks spring forward (EST→EDT). XNYS + XNAS affected. Phantom hour 2–3am ET.
- **March 10, 2026**: Hacker News "Show HN" launch. Tuesday 10am ET.
- **March 29, 2026**: UK/EU clocks spring forward (GMT→BST / CET→CEST). XLON + XPAR affected.
- **October 25, 2026**: UK/EU fall back. XLON + XPAR.
- **November 1, 2026**: US fall back. XNYS + XNAS.

## Context for Next Session
Start by reading:
1. This file (done)
2. `.claude/rules/00_engineering_standards.md` for hard rules
3. `.claude/rules/10_decisions.md` for architectural context
4. `OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md` for operational procedures
5. `src/index.ts` if touching core logic
